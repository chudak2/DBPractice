        "- Spread 1/2 tablespoon olive oil onto one side of each slice of bread. Then add both to a large nonstick frying pan on medium heat. Allow the bread to sit for about 30 seconds, and then remove one slice. \r\n\r\n- Add the mozzarella, then tomatoes, then basil to the slice of bread still on the pan. \r\n\r\n- Top with the second slice. Leave the sandwich on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n- (Check the bottom piece to see how brown it is after 2 minutes.)\r\n\r\n- Flip the sandwich and cook for another 3 minutes. \r\n\r\n- Enjoy with a pear on the side.",
